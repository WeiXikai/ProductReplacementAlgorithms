# ProductReplacementAlgorithms

## Introduction

This code is the part of project for lecture Computational Group Theory in Karlsruhe Institute of Technology.

This project includes three different product replacement algorithms, which are Frank's algorithm, Leedham's Algorithm and Henrik's algorithm.

We provide the code for all of these three algorithms both in Python and Julia.

## The Code in Julia

All the code for these three algorithms are in the file "JuliaCode.jl". 

In this file, there are three functions called "Frank", "Leedham" and "Henrik". Just call these functions we can get a random element of a permuatation group. The permutation group should be implement by using our struct "Permutation_Group".

## The Code in Python

The code in Python are splited into five files "frank.py", "leedham.py", "henrik.py", "lib.py" and "group.py".

You can change the group into your favorite version, just make sure that the muliple operator is overloaded.

Three different algorithms are in three corresponding files, which will make it more convenient to use.
